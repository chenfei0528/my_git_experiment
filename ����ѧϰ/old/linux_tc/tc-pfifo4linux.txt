     2	NAME
     3	       pfifo - Packet limited First In, First Out queue

     4	       bfifo - Byte limited First In, First Out queue


     5	SYNOPSIS
     6	       tc qdisc ... add pfifo [ limit packets ]

     7	       tc qdisc ... add bfifo [ limit bytes ]


     8	DESCRIPTION
     9	       The  pfifo  and  bfifo qdiscs are unadorned First In, First Out queues.
    10	       They are the simplest queues possible and therefore have  no  overhead.
    11	       pfifo  constrains the queue size as measured in packets.  bfifo does so
    12	       as measured in bytes.

    13	       Like all non-default qdiscs, they maintain statistics. This might be  a
    14	       reason to prefer pfifo or bfifo over the default.


    15	ALGORITHM
    16	       A  list  of  packets  is  maintained, when a packet is enqueued it gets
    17	       inserted at the tail of a list. When a packet needs to be sent  out  to
    18	       the network, it is taken from the head of the list.

    19	       If  the  list  is  too long, no further packets are allowed on. This is
    20	       called 'tail drop'.


    21	PARAMETERS
    22	       limit  Maximum queue size. Specified in bytes for bfifo, in packets for
    23	              pfifo. For pfifo, defaults to the interface txqueuelen, as spec-
    24	              ified with ifconfig(8) or ip(8).

    25	              For bfifo, it defaults  to  the  txqueuelen  multiplied  by  the
    26	              interface MTU.


    27	OUTPUT
    28	       The  output  of tc -s qdisc ls contains the limit, either in packets or
    29	       in bytes, and the number of bytes and packets actually sent. An  unsent
    30	       and  dropped  packet  only appears between braces and is not counted as
    31	       'Sent'.

    32	       In this example, the queue length is 100 packets, 45894 bytes were sent
    33	       over 681 packets.  No packets were dropped, and as the pfifo queue does
    34	       not slow down packets, there were also no overlimits:

    35	       # tc -s qdisc ls dev eth0
    36	       qdisc pfifo 8001: dev eth0 limit 100p
    37	        Sent 45894 bytes 681 pkts (dropped 0, overlimits 0)

    38	       If a backlog occurs, this is displayed as well.
